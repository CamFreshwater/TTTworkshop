## INTRODUCTION TO R MARKDOWN (EDWARDS)

Edwards presented an intro to the basics of R markdown. R markdown allows us to interspace text, R code, and R output. This is then elegantly converted into html, pdf, or word formats using the knitr package and pandoc (a universal document converter). Markdown is compatible with latex, but is a much simpler to learn markup language. Basic formatting options were presented.
Some recommendations included naming our code chunks using unique and useful descriptions (aids in using caches and finding errors) and that caches are useful when working with large datasets.

## INTRODUCTION TO **csasdown** (ANDERSON)

Pacific region has written an R package called csasdown to help authors write research documents formatted for Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat.  

After loading csasdown a template document can be produced using the following R code:

```{r create-draft-csas-doc, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(csasdown)
rmarkdown::draft("index.Rmd", template = "resdoc", package = "csasdown", create_dir = FALSE, edit = FALSE)
```
