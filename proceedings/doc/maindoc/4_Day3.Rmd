# DAY 3
The third day of the TTT workshop started with a presentation by Sean Anderson on R package development. Sean used materials from presentations by Harley Wickam (senior scientist at RStudio) to get participants started with developing R packages. The development of R packages is greatly simplified by using an RStudio's project and taking advantage of its many available tools related to package development. For example, one can create a project in RStudio and define it as an R package, and the software will create the necessary backbone of an R package. Sean covered the development of an R package, the generation of its documentation using ROxygen, unit testing of the package, and package testing.
