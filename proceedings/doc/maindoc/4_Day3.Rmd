# DAY 3

## GENERATING ENGLISH AND FRENCH FIGURES (GRINNELL)

## TRANSLATING CSAS DOCUMENTS (ANN MARISCAK)



## BREAK-OUT GROUPS

Workshop participants seperated out into five break-out groups.  Workshops participants were able to self-select which group they went to, which worked well.

The first of these groups worked on an applied example, in which they worked together to compose a trip report for a the Newfounland and Labradour Region using R markdown.

The second of these groups ... focussed on a brainstorming session about .. the development of tools to automate language translation of CSAS research documents ???

The remaining three groups worked on collaboratively writing text for this workshop proceedings document using GitHub, with each group tasked with summarizing one day of the workshop. A proceedings template document that met the format requirements of the Canadian Techncial Report was compiled ahead of time.The three report-writing groups were able to clone the relevant repository and make changes to the template.
