# TTTworkshop
TESA workshop on tools for transparent, traceable and transferable assessments

## Logistics

**When:** Tuesday 27th to Friday 30th November 2018 (note that these dates changed from the original announcement a while back).

**Where:** [Coast Bastion Hotel](https://www.coasthotels.com/hotels/bc/nanaimo/coast-bastion-hotel/), Nanaimo, BC.  

**Accommodation:** 
The hotel has set aside 20 hotel rooms for 26th-30th November, at $117 each (Comfort Rooms).
Phone group code CBI-GFC18589 or just use the link [http://coa.st/yuk5](http://coa.st/yuk5).

Please book once you know your travel plans as they like to see some uptake of the rooms. In any case, any unbooked rooms will be released on **27th October**.

**Flights**

Fly into Nanaimo airport (YCD). Air Canada Rouge now has direct flights from Toronto but not every day, so may be worth looking into.

Taxi is about $50 or there is a cheaper [https://nanaimoairporter.com/](shuttle bus). Good idea to book either one ahead (there aren't always too many taxis at the airport). Taxi info [http://www.nanaimoairport.com/air-guide/transportation](here). 

## Workshop outline (rough, subject to evolution)

### Purpose
A workshop to foster a common understanding of modern methods and tools
in DFO that enables an exchange of knowledge, data and methods for stock
assessment. This should lead to a greater transparency and reproducibility in the assessment process in DFO.

### Chairs
Andrew Edwards (PBS) & Daniel Duplisea (IML)



### Original schedule

**This was our original rough idea but will be updated a lot since the workshop is four days not five and we may not use TMB much**

#### Day 1

Motivation for workshop (Duplisea and Edwards).

Introduction to git and GitHub for easily sharing code and collaborating (Edwards and Grandin).

#### Day 2

Running of a catch-at-age model in TMB (Template Model Builder) and
importing some results into a knitr/LaTeX format to automatically
generate figures and tables. The structure for setting up such a system
will be explained, based on our experiences with annual Pacific Hake and
Pacific Herring assessments. If the model changes then the whole document
is automatically updated, including figures, tables and values in the
text. This is especially valuable for assessments conducted annually.
Led by Edwards, Grandin, Anderson, Grinnell, ... 
 
#### Days 3-5

 Participants to improve the existing TMB, figure and table code. They
 would extend code in a way that is generalizable, understandable and
 usable by others (e.g. R functions that are documented with options),
 while satisfying their local needs. Simpler surplus-production and
 delay-difference model examples could also be built. Participants can use
 their own existing code and make it generalisable to be used by others.

 As an example, there are likely many versions of R code that people use
 to display results of stock status with respect to the DFO
 Precautionary-Approach diagram. We could agree on one standardised
 (but still customisable) version across DFO.

The workshop is very timely as it builds on the recent TESA "Introduction to TMB
workshop" that DFO participants attended and gave very favourable reviews.
If DFO stock assessment scientists are going to convert their existing models
into TMB then it makes sense to at least start from some common methdology. This
will also make it easier to incorporate ecosystem effects into such models,
since TMB code is relatively short, and common starting point will allow
assessors in different regions to build upon each others' experiences. 

Note that
the aim is **not** to have all assessors using the exact same models, but to start
from a similar understanding, to share understanding in building stock
assessment documents, and to generate efficiencies by easily sharing computer code.

## Prerequisites
Very proficient in R: know how to write functions, construct and tailor figures.

Some TMB knowledge desirable (maybe).

Knowledge of LaTeX desirable, though Rmarkdown and pandoc may be introduced also.

## Computer programs to be installed

To be determined.

## Products

Proceedings (Can. Tech. Rep.), which can hopefully be collaboratively written during the workshop as an example of efficiently producing a document.

GitHub repositories to share code.
